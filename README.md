# Online Mail Management System with Django

A fully functional website built with Django to keep records of all posted incoming and posted outgoing offcial documents/letters for an orginazation. 

As a summer intern at PCAA, I helped to automate manual diary-keeping records for Mailing System in the IT department by building a website with Django and Postgres DB. This website improved the productivity of the IT department for entering a record and searching a record among thousands of records from 20 to 2 minutes per document.


## Features

- Admin User can login/logout from frontend.
- 2 seperate pages for handing incoming & outgoing.
- CRUD functionality (Search by different fields).
- Most recently added records on Home Page.
- Total incoming, outgoing records in the DB.
